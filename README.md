1. Project Status: Overview
This project serves as a robust, multi-file skeleton for the Zappy Bot app. It is a fully functional starting point with key features already implemented.

‚úÖ What's Working:
Project Structure: A clear and organized file structure for screens, navigation, and API clients has been established.

Dependencies: All required packages for navigation (React Navigation) and authentication (Supabase) are installed and configured.

Supabase Client: The Supabase client file is in place and ready for your unique project credentials.

Authentication Flow: The App.js file correctly handles the user's authentication state, dynamically switching between the AuthStack (Sign In/Sign Up) and the AppTabs (main app screens) based on user login status.

User Registration & Login: The SignUpScreen and SignInScreen are fully functional and use Supabase for authentication.

User Sign-Out: A sign-out button on the DashboardScreen correctly logs the user out, returning them to the sign-in page.

Main Navigation: The AppTabs navigator provides a working bottom tab bar with placeholder screens for all the main features.

üöß What's Not Working (Next Steps):
API Configuration: The supabase/client.js file contains placeholder URL and anon keys. You must replace these with your actual Supabase credentials for authentication to work.

Dynamic Content: All main app screens (DashboardScreen, LeadsPageScreen, BotSettingsScreen, etc.) are currently placeholders with static text. They are not yet connected to a backend to display real-time data.

Business Logic: The core functionality for features like the ChatFlowBuilder and the Analytics dashboard is completely absent and needs to be implemented.

UI/UX: The current user interface is a basic, functional style. The app needs a complete visual overhaul to match the Zappy Bot brand identity.

2. Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Clone the Repository: Once this project is in a repository, clone it to your local machine.

Install Dependencies: From the project root, run the following command to install all necessary packages.

npm install

Configure Supabase: Open the file at supabase/client.js and add your unique Supabase URL and public anon key.

Run the App: In the terminal, run the following command and scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone.

npm start

3. Clear Next Steps
Here is a recommended sequence of tasks to move the project forward:

[CRITICAL] Configure Supabase: As mentioned above, this is the most critical first step.

Start with the Dashboard: Begin fetching and displaying real data on the DashboardScreen. This is a great way to practice connecting your front end to your database.

Flesh out the Leads Page: Implement the logic and UI for the LeadsPageScreen to list and manage customer leads.

Build the Chat Flow Builder: This is a major feature and should be tackled next. Start by designing the UI for a drag-and-drop interface.

Refine the UI: As you build out the functionality, begin to customize the styling of all screens to match your brand.
